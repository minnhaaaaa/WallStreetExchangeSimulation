The Wall Street Exchange is a project that aims to simulate the stock exchange trading experience.  
Through fluctuating stock prices, sentiment influenced by news, and sporadic economic events, the  
simulation simulates actual market activity. In addition to managing portfolios, buying and selling  
stocks, and observing market movements, players can respond to daily headlines that impact industries.  
Unpredictability and risk are brought about by sporadic market occurrences like booms, crashes, and  
scandals. Additional realism and depth are provided via sentiment-based news analysis and insider tips.  
The objective is to provide a fun and instructive platform that uses gamification to illustrate financial  
principles, data management, and algorithmic logic.
